> It goes without saying that the kitchen duty is extremely important, joyful and fun!
  The never-ending chatter, laughter, carrying around pots and pans, playing with water (aka wash up),
  smell of curry and sound of sizzling oils. It's amazing that you can have such fun conversations
  when you are waist-deep into a black pot trying to clean up some stubborn stain! There's of course
  so much more to the kitchen team! It's also a real work-out, both physical, and spiritual.
  If that sounds like you, consider joining the kitchen duties!

Generally speaking, the kitchen duties can be distributed to 3 sub-teams:

{{% details title="Kitchen cleaning team" closed="true" %}}
Kitchen cleaning team is responsible for cleaning the kitchen area. This is **NOT** cleaning
the plates and cutlery in the back of the kitchen. The job of this team is to clean the kitchen
and food prepartion area. This includes:

- All the pots and pans
- Cooking utensils
- All food preparation surfaces (including tables that food is prepared on)
- Ovens, stoves, urns etc.
- Kitchen floor
- Kitchen machines (mixers etc.)
- Food prep area washbasins (these are used for washing rice and vegetables)

{{< callout type="warning">}}
Ensure that items are placed in the correct place after being cleaned. Ask the kitchen
manager if you don't know where something goes.
{{< /callout>}}

**1-2 people from the kitchen cleaning team are needed during the food preparation** because sometimes pots
or kitchen tools need to be cleaned during food prep.
However **most of the duties of the cleaning team starts after the food.**
So eat your food calmly and get to work after that!

{{% details title="Food preparation team" closed="true" %}}
Food preparation team is responsible for, wait for it, preparing the food!!!
Lots of cutting, chopping, washing, and running around. Fiarly simple and fun
work with a few simple rules to follow:

- Listen to the kitchen manager
- Do as you are told
- Do not argue with the kitchen manager

{{< callout type="warning">}}
Do not disturb the chef and the cooks! If you need anything, talk to the kitchen manager

There are multiple washbasins near the food prep area. Choose one to be used for washing rice and the
rest for washing vegetables. Do not use these washbasins for anything else! If one is used for anything else,
please wash and disinfect the washbasin.

The food prep work **starts hours before the meal**. If you are preparing the breakfast,
be in the kitchen at 6am. If you are preparing the lunch, be in the kitchen after breakfast. 
If you are preparing the dinner, be in the kitchen around 3pm.

{{% details title="Serving team" closed="true" %}}
Serving team is responsible for serving the food and cleaning the general eating area.
The duties of the serving team are:

- Clean the eating and serving areas (including the tables)
- Prepare the plats, bowls, utensils, and cups
- Serve the food!!!

{{< callout type="info">}}
You can leave your duty when there are no more crowds waiting for food.
If there is food leftover, ask the kitchen manager what do with it.

Besides the above sub-teams, there is the kitchen manager who's responsible for many things such as safety and hygiene,
communication, and general kitchen management. This is a very demanding task which requires constant presence in the kitchen.
Not many Yogis know the details of this work so the hosting countries should try to provide one person to be the assistant to the kitchen manager.
In this way we can reduce the load and share the knowledge. Note that it's not easy to be the assistant to the kitchen manager and this role
must be filled with a suitable person. It's better to not fill the role than to provide a not-suitable person.

{{< callout type="warning">}}
It's important to keep the meal timings fixed! The kitchen almost works like a machine with its own rhythm.
Changing the time of one meal will impact the timings for the whole day!
{{< /callout>}}

The cooks have a big responsibility and generally know what they are doing. Please do not disturb them! If you have any question,
bring it to the kitchen manager. The kitchen manager is, among other things, the contact between the cooks and helpers and the rest of the Yogis.
