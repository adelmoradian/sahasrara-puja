Next meeting 1st of March
{{< /callout >}}

- We don't have a professional florist yet.
  Silvester following up on his end for the flower team.
  Radek can follow up on his side too although they are not professional.
  Miklos might be able to get a professional from Hungary.
- Gabi from Austria will be in the kitchen team again.
- For the Tali, we still need Yogis from Czech Republic and Slovakia to give volunteers.
  If we know people who have the desire or experience of cooking for Shri Mataji,
  we should volunteer. Must to coordinate with Castle to make sure we have the
  correct number of people. They can tell us how many people we can have. The person
  cooking for Mother must know what she is cooking as Shri Mataji used to ask
  about where the food is coming from and what it is. Food can be offered
  at lunch time and after Puja. The tali team will only work on the tali on the
  Puja day and should not have any other duties.
- Backdrop is in progress.
- Would be nice if this year someone from a different country prepares the invite.
  Should be ready before 21st of March. There is also a second invitation
  that coordinators will offer to Shri Mataji on Thursday or Friday. Invitation
  can be written in the native language of the Yogis. The invitation should not be
  a big story! On the website it should be a short expression of feeling and invite
  to share the joy and worship of Shri Adi Shakti. There is also an element of motivating
  Yogis to come!
- Gifts for Shri Mataji - It would be if on the 5th of May all the hosting countries
  can give a gift as a token of gratitude. It can be anything and not just jewelry.
  Lakshmi baskets can be prepared for the school specifically also. It would be nice
  if we can have collective Lakshmi baskets. Pujaris tell us that so many
  Lakshmi baskets are not needed. We will get a list from the castle about
  the things that can be in the Lakshmi basket. Items in the Lakshmi basket
  should be artistic and practical.
- Last year there was a suggestion that an outside team should take care
  of cleaning the toilets. It costs around 500 Euros. For the 1st of March
  meeting we should decide this.
- We divided the names of Deities between multiple between. This is nice however
  the flow got disrupted a bit. We need to decide on how many people should read
  the names and what names so that they can practice and read them nicely. This should
  also be decided on the 1st.
- In Austria we have purchased the towels for Shri Mataji's room. We are working
  on the pattern. As soon as the pattern is done, we can share it so that other countries
  can also contribute.
- Germany is working on a bed cover at the moment.
- Czech is already working on getting the bus

Short summary: The Puja team should try to get more Yogis involved and aware
of the process. We also need to pay special attention to entertainment programs
as they serve an important purpose in these events.
{{< /callout >}}

- Fundamentally, this whole thing is for our own growth.
- Communicate the developments and decisions to the collective so that more Yogis can get involved.
  Local Yogis are very keen to hear the info and communications that come back from the coordinators group.
  This year we should try our best to get more yogis of the hosting collectives involved.
- We should rotate the role of leading the Puja so that it's not always Austria and aunty Edith.
  This year it seems to be aunty Barbara from Germany.
- About the entertainment program, there's a "prime time" in a way that Saturday is the main time of the event. Last year, the
  Indian musicians played very late. Why not get the Indian musicians play first at the better time? Saturday 9pm for example.
  There is no need to have a super long meditation before an evening program. If we have performers who will play Ragas or
  meditative music, that can be the start of the evening program. So in a way, blending the end of the
  evening meditation and beginning of the entertainment program.
- We should provide some guidance to Yogis about the importance of Indian classical music. Yogis shouldn't
  just leave as soon as the Ragas start.
- Communication around the evening programs should be improved so that they Yogis can know better
  what is planned for the evening.
- The evening program cannot start earlier than 8:30pm because various reasons. For example, the kitchen team
  needs time to prepare and serve dinner, the AV team needs to prepare the equipment etc. These constraints need
  to be communicate to the Yogis so that they can understand why things must happen in a certain way.
- The name "entertainment" is somewhat misleading because in the Puja it is actually a spiritual event and there's a protocol to it.
  We should use these 3 days to do everything we can to go deeper. We can always have entertainment when we are home! Entertainment should be
  a spiritually uplifting event. We can't meditate 24/7 but should use the time wisely.
- Some Yogis perform every year but there are some other Yogis who are deep and do not come forward. Maybe they need a bit of a push.
  We should support new people to come along and perform if they want. This should come from the country coordinators.
- We should communicate that besides the Yogis, the programs are for Mother. Things should be done in a way that pleases Her.
- Last year the photo of Mother during the performance was too large and the AV team had some issues in their work so this year we should
  use the correct sized photo if we want to do this.
- By mid of Feb we should fix the backdrop, artists, gifts.
- On the 5th of May in the morning around 10:30am have a small offering by the country representatives then
  keep the living room open and Yogis can meditate there with live music. We don't need to do a second Puja
  on the 5th.
- Thursday before the weekend we should start cleaning the Castle.
- It's best if people from hosting countries are there 2 weeks before ideally.
