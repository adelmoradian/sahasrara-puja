# Meeting Notes

{{% details title="24.01.2026" closed="true" %}}
{{< callout >}}
Short summary: The Puja team should try to get more Yogis involved and aware
of the process. We also need to pay special attention to entertainment programs
as they serve an important purpose in these events.
{{< /callout >}}

- Fundamentally, this whole thing is for our own growth.
- Communicate the developments and decisions to the collective so that more Yogis can get involved.
  Local Yogis are very keen to hear the info and communications that come back from the coordinators group.
  This year we should try our best to get more yogis of the hosting collectives involved.
- We should rotate the role of leading the Puja so that it's not always Austria and aunty Edith.
  This year it seems to be aunty Barbara from Germany.
- About the entertainment program, there's a "prime time" in a way that Saturday is the main time of the event. Last year, the
  Indian musicians played very late. Why not get the Indian musicians play first at the better time? Saturday 9pm for example.
  There is no need to have a super long meditation before an evening program. If we have performers who will play Ragas or
  meditative music, that can be the start of the evening program. So in a way, blending the end of the
  evening meditation and beginning of the entertainment program.
- We should provide some guidance to Yogis about the importance of Indian classical music. Yogis shouldn't
  just leave as soon as the Ragas start.
- Communication around the evening programs should be improved so that they Yogis can know better
  what is planned for the evening.
- The evening program cannot start earlier than 8:30pm because various reasons. For example, the kitchen team
  needs time to prepare and serve dinner, the AV team needs to prepare the equipment etc. These constraints need
  to be communicate to the Yogis so that they can understand why things must happen in a certain way.
- The name "entertainment" is somewhat misleading because in the Puja it is actually a spiritual event and there's a protocol to it.
  We should use these 3 days to do everything we can to go deeper. We can always have entertainment when we are home! Entertainment should be
  a spiritually uplifting event. We can't meditate 24/7 but should use the time wisely.
- Some Yogis perform every year but there are some other Yogis who are deep and do not come forward. Maybe they need a bit of a push.
  We should support new people to come along and perform if they want. This should come from the country coordinators.
- We should communicate that besides the Yogis, the programs are for Mother. Things should be done in a way that pleases Her.
- Last year the photo of Mother during the performance was too large and the AV team had some issues in their work so this year we should
  use the correct sized photo if we want to do this.
- By mid of Feb we should fix the backdrop, artists, gifts.
- On the 5th of May in the morning around 10:30am have a small offering by the country representatives then
  keep the living room open and Yogis can meditate there with live music. We don't need to do a second Puja
  on the 5th.
- Thursday before the weekend we should start cleaning the Castle.
- It's best if people from hosting countries are there 2 weeks before ideally.
